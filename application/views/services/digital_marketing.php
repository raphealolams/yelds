			<p>Who are your website visitors, and where are they coming from? What information are they seeking, and what makes them take
			 action on your site? These are the types of questions that we explore with web analytics- the analysis of the data surrounding 
			 your website traffic. The answers we uncover inform a host of marketing decisions, from which marketing channels to focus on to what
		 kind of content to produce. Delivered to you in regular reports, they can also help you make data-driven business decisions 
			 concerning the markets you serve, the products you offer, the segments you focus your energy on and more. 
			At the end of the day, this all leads to a healthier bottom line for your business.</p>

				<h2>Content Marketing</h2>
					<br/>
					<p>
Content marketing is all about rising above the noise these days. Achieving thousands of social shares and comments is not luck;
 it’s the result of good planning, knowing what your audience is looking for and creating content that is unique and worth sharing. 
 We help clients develop a content strategy, steer their publications with an editorial calendar and provide the creative and technical 
 resources to keep a consistent flow of quality content that will engage the target audience.

				<h2>SEO</h2>
			         <br/>
					<p>We approach search engine optimization with a user-first mentality. Instead of trying to decode search engine algorithms,
					 we focus on proper website structure, clear information architecture, and informative metadata and markup. By combining these
					  elements with outstanding content, we provide users with the experience and information they want.
					 This approach improves search rankings and increases quality organic traffic for our clients in a healthy and sustainable way..</p>

					<h2>Email Marketing</h2>
					<br/>
					<p>Email marketing is a powerful method of connecting with valuable customers, clients, prospects and others interested in your business.
				 When creating your email marketing strategy, we consider the audiences being reached, the content that each audience needs and
				  when they need it. We think about whether the content should be packaged into a multi-email campaign, whether any emails should 
				  be automated and how your emails fit into your marketing strategy as a whole. The result is an email plan that works with your
				   other marketing initiatives to build a valuable relationship with your audience.</p>

					<h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>You may be surprised that great social media isn’t created on a whim. 
					You start with a social media strategy that defines a target audience and solidifies a brand mission and voice. 
					We provide social content themes, a posting schedule and tactics for increasing reach and engagement across the social networks that
					 are relevant for your business. 
					The day to day stuff is a lot more fun when people are interacting and the strategy is working.</p>

				<h2>Brand Imagery</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>The true value of your web traffic depends on your website’s ability to convert visitors to customers. 
					Using landing pages, a/b testing, and analytics, we identify and implement website changes that lead more of your
					 web traffic to your website’s finish line- whether it be an email signup, a phone call to your sales team, 
					 or an online purchase. Through this process of conversion rate optimization (CRO), your business gets more value 
					 from the web traffic it’s already attracting.</p>
